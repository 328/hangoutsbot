# Contributing to Hangoutsbot

:tada: Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

Here are some guidelines to help you get started. If you follow these suggestions then it will make your contribution easier for us to review and, hopefully, accept. It will also save you time when contributing.

## Using the Issue Tracker
The [issue tracker](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/issues) is used for submitting bugs, feature requests or other issues regarding the code that should be brought to attention of other developers and bot admins. Questions should only be asked if they are not answered anywhere else in the issue tracker or the wiki.

#### Title
 * Include at the start of the title a tag for what category the issue falls under. For example: "[plugin] Telesync not syncing images".
 * Be very clear about where you think the bug is happening, or which plugin you want the feature request in. Because different parts of the bot is worked on by different developers, you want the right developers to, at a glance, immediately know that the issue is relevant to their code. "SlackRTM Plugin TypeError" is better than "Error when trying to use bot".
 * Include the error type when you can, this prevents duplicate bug reports from being filed, as users can easily see if their bug has already been reported.  

#### Description
 * Include as much detail as you can, including transcripts and screenshots where relevant.  

#### Replying to an issue
 * When replying to an issue, make references to code and PR's that are important in the discussion. It's encouraged even if it's referencing another repository on Github!

## Making a Pull Request (PR)
* Please make your pull request to *staging* rather than *master*
* Update the wiki documentation where relevant before making the pull request
* If you've updated the wiki, include a note in your PR that you've done so  
It's rare that a pull request will be approved straight out. Don't be discouraged if you're asked to do a review or modify code a little! Discussion of the code is encouraged here, before it gets merged into the repository.

## Updating the Wiki
 * TODO
